    Kate has been a fangirl for most of her life. Her first true love is <i>Star Wars</i>; Kate's aunt played the VHS for <i>A New Hope</i> when she was five years old, and the rest is history. Kate's current favorite fandoms are <i>Star Wars</i>, <i>The Witcher</i>, and <i>The Last of Us</i>. Her interests span these franchise's video games, films, television shows, and written material.
    <br><br>
    Kate co-founded <a class="normal" href="www.bookwarspod.com">Book Wars Pod</a>, a podcast exploring multimedia storytelling through the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise. The podcast covers the <i>Star Wars</i> books, video games, television shows, comics, and, of course, the films, with a focus on how these media intersect and inform one another to create a rich, multifacted fictional universe.
    <br><br>
    As a podcast co-host, Kate has moderated and participated in panels at fan conventions, including Washington, DC's Awesome Con and <i>Star Wars</i> Celebration Chicago. Panel topics have included diversity in <i>Star Wars</i> media, in terms of both characters and creators, as well as how <i>Star Wars</i> storytelling has operated since the formation of the <a class="normal" href="https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/star-wars-celebration-lucasfilm-story-group/">Lucasfilm Story Group</a>.
    <br><br>
    Kate is also a co-founder of #SWRepMatters, a movement that began as a social media hashtag campaign to raise awareness about what <i>Star Wars</i> does well in terms of diversity, and where it can improve. Each month, the #SWRepMatters planning group decides on a marginalized group to highlight in particular in a social media discussion that anyone can join. Past campaigns have focused on Black women, queer representation, body diversity, and the disabled community.
    <br><br>
    Kate has co-written for <a class="normal" href="http://eleven-thirtyeight.com/2017/10/making-diversity-seen-and-heard-why-star-wars-must-fully-embrace-its-multimedia-identity/">ElevenThirtyEight</a> and is a staff writer for <a class="normal" href="http://toschestation.net/author/kate/">Tosche Station</a>, the latter of whose podcast network Book Wars Pod is a member.
